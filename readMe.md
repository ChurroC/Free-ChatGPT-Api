Script was working but chatgpt site changed and don't want to go through the hastle of this again so not gonna get updated.

This is a personal script that you must host yourself on a server or on your computer to open up api endpoints that lets you interact with chat gpt for free.
You must first fill out the env then run "npm run start:dev" or you could create enviorment variables on the server and use "npm run start"
